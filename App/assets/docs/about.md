"Experience what it means to translate the club's nearly 100-year-old values into our modern world." TABLER.WORLD is an important part of that story and the best thing that could happen to all of us. As a digital native, for me personally such a platform is crucial for local and international exchange.

... and I just wanted the thing on my phone. End of story.

I hope you have just as much fun with that App as it made me realize the idea.

The whole TABLER.WORLD team is always looking forward to your feedback. Suggestions? Improvements? Just drop us a note.

We're no longer hard to reach now. Just skake your device :)

Yours in Table
